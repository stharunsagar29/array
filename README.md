#ðŸ“¦ Python Array Operations Demo
This script showcases how to work with arrays in Python using the built-in array module. It includes examples of creating an array, searching for elements, modifying values, and applying conditional logic to update array contents.
ðŸ”§ Features
- Create an array of integers using array.array
- Search for a specific value and return its index
- Modify an element at a given index
- Conditionally update values greater than a threshold
ðŸ§ª Sample Output
Original array: array('i', [10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
Element 30 found at index 2
Modified array: array('i', [10, 20, 35, 40, 50])
Conditionally modified array: array('i', [10, 20, 40, 45, 55])


ðŸš€ How to Run
Just copy the code into a .py file and run it using any Python 3 interpreter.
